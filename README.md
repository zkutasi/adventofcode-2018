# adventofcode-2018

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2018 Challenges (https://adventofcode.com/).

* All of them is written with Python 2.7
* All of them are unique solutions that was not done with any peeking on existing ones, there are few exceptions though when I hopelessly got stuck and I went to the Reddit page of solutions to see how people approached the problem
* Many of them take parameters (like the input file to read, or how many cycles to execute, etc...), earlier ones have these hard-coded (I might be rewriting them, not sure)
* Some of them provide visual representation of the problem (maybe there is code inside but switched off)
* Some of them may be not optimal, but they finish on time, some of them are really quick though
